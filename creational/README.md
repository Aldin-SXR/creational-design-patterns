# Creational Design Patterns

**Creational patterns** provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. The common types of creational patterns are:
- factory method
- abstract factory
- builder
- prototype
- singleton

## Factory Method

**Factory method** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface or an abstract class for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to decide the type of objects that will be created.

- [About Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/-factory-method)
- [Example implementation](https://github.com/Aldin-SXR/creational-design-patterns/tree/master/creational/factoryMethod)

## Abstract Factory

**Abstract factory** is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. 

- [About Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)
- [Example implementation](https://github.com/Aldin-SXR/creational-design-patterns/tree/master/creational/abstractFactory)

## Singleton

**Singleton** is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

- [About Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)
- [Example implementation](https://github.com/Aldin-SXR/creational-design-patterns/tree/master/creational/singleton)

## Builder

**Builder** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. This pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

- [About Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)
- [Example implementation](https://github.com/Aldin-SXR/creational-design-patterns/tree/master/creational/builder)

## Prototype

**Prototype** is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

- [About Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)
- [Example implementation](https://github.com/Aldin-SXR/design-patterns/tree/master/creational/prototype)
