# Structural Design Patterns

**Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures *flexible* and *efficient*. The most commonly used structural patterns are:
- adapter
- bridge
- composite
- decorator
- facade
- flyweight
- proxy
- ...

## Adapter

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

- [About Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)
- [Example implementation](https://github.com/Aldin-SXR/creational-design-patterns/tree/master/structural/adapter)


## Composite

**Composite** is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

- [About Composite](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite)
- [Example implementation](https://github.com/Aldin-SXR/creational-design-patterns/tree/master/structural/composite)
- 
## Decorator

**Decorator** is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

- [About Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)
- [Example implementation](https://github.com/Aldin-SXR/creational-design-patterns/tree/master/structural/decorator)
  
## Facade

**Facade** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
