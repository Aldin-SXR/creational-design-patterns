# Structural Design Patterns

**Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures *flexible* and *efficient*. The most commonly used structural patterns are:
- adapter
- bridge
- composite
- decorator
- facade
- flyweight
- proxy
- ...

## Adapter

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## Composite

**Composite** is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## Decorator

**Decorator** is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

## Facade

**Facade** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
