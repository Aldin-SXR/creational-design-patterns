# Behavioral Design Patterns

**Behavioral design patterns** are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. The most commonly used behavioral patterns are:
- chain of responsibility
- command
- iterator
- mediator
- memento
- observer
- state
- strategy
- template method
- visitor
- ...

## Command

**Command** is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

## Strategy

**Strategy** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

## Template Method

**Template Method** is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
